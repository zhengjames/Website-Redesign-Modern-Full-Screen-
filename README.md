# Website-Redesign-Modern-Full-Screen-
Redesigned UC Davis's Summer Sessions website to a full screen landing page.
The website is under Cascade Content Management System. The code in this repository overrides the default structure and design.
I highly recomment using separate .css files and name them accordingly.
